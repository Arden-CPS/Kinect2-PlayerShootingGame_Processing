# Kinect2-PlayerShootingGame_Processing
This is a Processing-based Kinect game that uses the SimpleOpenNI library to track one of the players, while the other one tries to click on the first player's head to score points. This is not a finished product, and could still be improved. For instance the movement of the red dot on the first player's head is not very fluid, and could be improved.
